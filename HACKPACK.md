# My Hackpack

A "hackpack" is a compilation of implementations of various algorithms, data structures, and niche problems that have a good chance of showing up in contests; it functions as a safety net during the implementation stage of developing a solution. As I gain more experience through mocking past contests, upsolving problems, and competing in live competitions, the code in the hackpack that I bring to each contest will change.
