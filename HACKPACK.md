# My Hackpack

A "hackpack" is a compilation of implementations of various algorithms, data structures, and niche problems that have a good chance of showing up in contests; it functions as a safety net during the implementation stage of developing a solution. As I gain more experience through mocking past contests, upsolving problems, and competing in live competitions, the code in the hackpack that I bring to each contest will change.

### Algorithms

The algorithm implementations I currently bring to competitions are listed below.

### Data Structures

The data structure implementations I currently bring to competitions are listed below.
* [Fenwick Tree (a.k.a. Binary Indexed Tree or BIT)](https://github.com/vmaddur/Competitive_Programming/blob/master/Miscellaneous/rotatingcards.cpp)
* [Point Update Segment Tree](https://github.com/vmaddur/Competitive_Programming/blob/master/Miscellaneous/holygrailwar.cpp)
* [Lazy Propagation Segment Tree](https://github.com/vmaddur/Competitive_Programming/blob/master/USACO/2015%20Platinum%20December%20Contest/haybales.cpp)

### Niche Problems

The niche problem implementations I currently bring to competitions are listed below.

### Miscellaneous

Other useful implementations that do not fall under any of the three categories above are listed below.
